# APOD

This is an Android application which implements API of Astronomy Picture of the Day site (https://apod.nasa.gov/)

The main purpose of this development is to learn Retrofit2 myself and get more practice in Kotlin language and Material Design

However, if you like this application you are free to use it. (But without any warranties!)
